  <p><h1>HTML Fundamentals</h1></p>  
  <br>
  <p><h2>What is HTML?</h2></p>
  <p>Hypertext markup language. it is the language that web browsers read to build a web page. <br>
it acts as a 'blueprint' to display data on a user's screen. This is the basic building block of <br>
the web. Every page on the internet is just HTML at its core.</p>
<br>
<p><h2>What are HTML-Elements?</h2></p>
<p>Elements are what we use to tell the browser how we want the data supplied to be <br>
    displayed.</p>
    <br>
    <p><h2>What is a tag?</h2></p>
    <p>An element consists of an opening and closing tag. The data supplied between the tags will.<br>
        be displayed per the instructions of the element.</p>
        <br>
        <p><h2>How does the browser use HTML to create what I see?</h2></p>
        <p>The browser reads and interprets the HTML file to understand how the developer intended <br>
            the data to appear on the screen.</p>
            <br>
            <p><h2>What are the basic HTML-Elements?</h2></p>
            <p>The elements we learned about were html, head, body, ‘p’, span, div, and h1-h6.</p>
            <br>
            <p><h1>More Elements</h1></p>
            <br>
            <p><h2>A-tag</h2></p>
            <p>The ‘a’ (“anchor”) element, allows us to create links to other web pages (or even to other <br>
                areas within our own web page). You will always see the ‘a’ element used with <br>
                the href attribute to tell the browser what address you want the link to point to.</p>

                <p><h2>Img-tag</h2></p>
                <p>This element will display an image on the screen. It will always have an ‘src’ attribute which <br>
                    points to the address of the image to be displayed. NOTE: img tags can be self-closing, as in <br>
                    they do not need two tags. Simply put the / before the closing bracket in the first tag:</p>
